This Visual Studio 2013 extension helps when debugging any VS extension that you are building. It adds a new menu item to the Debug menu in Visual Studio that, when clicked or run by the CTRL-F8 shortbut key, cleans the expertimental instance registry hive and the user %appdata% local directory before it starts the debugging process.

This enables you to start with a clean state for your experimental instance when trying to debug your extension.
